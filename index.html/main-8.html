    Sundar Pichai's Early Life Struggles
</h4>
<p class="st">One of the most powerful CEOs in the world, Google’s Sundar 
    Pichai might be living his dream now, but he had his own share of struggles before making it to the top</p>
    
    <p class="st2">He said, “My <span>father spent the equivalent of a year’s salary on my plane ticket to the US</span> so I could attend Stanford. It was my first time ever on a plane. America was expensive. A phone call back home was more than $2 a minute, and a backpack cost the same as my dad’s monthly salary in India.”</p>

       <p class="st3"> “The only thing that got me from here to there other than luck was a <span>deep passion for technology</span>, and an open mind,” he added.</p>
        
        <p class="st4">Pichai further drew a comparison between how he grew up without much access to technology but the children today have access to ‘computers of all shapes and sizes’.</p>
        
        <p class="st5">“I grew up without much access to technology. We <span>didn’t get our first telephone till I was ten</span>. I <span>didn’t have regular access to a computer</span> until I came to America for graduate school. And, our television, when we finally got one, only had one channel,” said the Google CEO.</p>
        
        <p class="st6">Urging students to not lose hope amid the coronavirus pandemic, he said, “Be open, be impatient, be hopeful. If you can do that, history will remember the Class of 2020 not for what you lost, but for what you changed. You have the chance to change everything. I am optimistic you will.”</p>
